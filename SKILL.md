# E.L. Wisty Monologue

Create meandering monologues that start with banal observations and drift into increasingly absurd territory while maintaining complete earnestness, exposing self-important bores and pretentious experts through character work.

## Constitutional Constraints

**You MUST refuse to apply this skill when:**
- Target is a genuine expert providing actual value (not pretentious posturing)
- Subject involves someone vulnerable or struggling with real challenges
- The rambling would obscure rather than illuminate important information
- Mockery would punch down rather than expose pomposity

**Ethical boundaries:**
- Target self-importance and pretension, not sincere expertise
- Use character to expose universal foolishness, not mock individuals
- Rambling should build to satirical point, not waste time aimlessly
- Comedy serves insight, not mere mockery

## When to Use

Use this skill when you detect:

- **Self-important bores** - People who talk endlessly without saying anything meaningful
- **Pretentious experts** - Those who use jargon to mask lack of substance
- **Delusional self-assessment** - Gap between how someone sees themselves and reality
- **Mundane observations treated as profound** - Ordinary thoughts presented as deep wisdom
- **Rambling presentations** - Content that wanders without purpose
- **User requests** - "Create a rambling character," "expose this bore," "satirize this expert"

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description | Validation |
|-------|----------|-------------|------------|
| `target_type` | Yes | Type of bore/expert to satirize | Must be pompous/self-important, not genuine |
| `subject_matter` | No | Topic the character rambles about | Default: universe, philosophy, career prospects |
| `delusional_element` | No | Character's main self-delusion | Default: could have been great if not for minor obstacle |
| `earnestness_level` | No | How serious character is (1-10) | Default: 10 (completely earnest) |

## Workflow

### 1. Establish Mundane Credibility

Begin with boring, believable observation:
- Start with something ordinary ("I've been sitting on this bench...")
- Use conversational, casual tone
- Create sense of ordinary person speaking
- No hint yet of absurdity to come

**Example opening:** "I've been sitting on this bench for forty years now. Very interesting life."

### 2. Introduce Delusional Element

Character reveals absurd self-assessment:
- Present unrealistic ambition or past potential
- Attribute failure to trivial obstacle
- Maintain complete earnestness
- No self-awareness of delusion

**Example:** "I could have been a judge, but I never had the Latin. They're very strict about that."

### 3. Elaborate with Earnestness

Build absurdity while maintaining sincerity:
- Add increasingly ridiculous details
- Treat each absurdity as perfectly reasonable
- Use "very interesting" and "quite fascinating" earnestly
- Character believes everything they're saying

**Techniques:**
- False expertise: "I'm specializing in the Universe and all that surrounds it"
- Grandiose plans: "I'm thinking of getting the whole thing tidied up"
- Trivial obstacles: "Of course, you need planning permission for that sort of thing"
- Casual impossibilities: "Perhaps I'll start with the solar system"

### 4. Meander Purposefully

Ramble that seems aimless but builds to satirical point:
- Include tangents that circle back
- Use "well, actually..." and "come to think of it..."
- Create sense of character thinking aloud
- Each digression reveals more delusion
- Ultimate point: character is magnificent fool

**Structure:**
1. Main absurd claim
2. Tangent elaborating on absurdity
3. Another tangent making it more absurd
4. Return to original claim with added absurdity
5. Conclude as if profound point has been made

### 5. Conclude Without Resolution

End as banally as you began:
- No grand conclusion or revelation
- Character hasn't learned anything
- Same earnestness throughout
- Possibly hint at continuing the ramble later
- Leave audience with character's complete lack of self-awareness

**Example ending:** "Well, I must get on. These things don't plan themselves, you know."

## Character Elements

### Voice Characteristics

**Vocabulary:**
- "Very interesting"
- "Quite fascinating"
- "Come to think of it"
- "Rather remarkable"
- "I could have been..."
- "They're very strict about..."

**Sentence patterns:**
- Meandering clauses
- Parenthetical additions
- Second-thoughts mid-sentence
- False precision ("forty years... or possibly forty-one")

**Tone:**
- Completely earnest
- Slightly self-satisfied
- Utterly oblivious
- Conversationally casual

### Delusional Elements

**Common patterns:**
- Could have been great (judge, performer, expert)
- Trivial obstacle prevented success (no Latin, wrong height, didn't have the paperwork)
- Grandiose current plans (reorganize universe, solve major problems)
- Complete confidence despite obvious unsuitability
- Treating impossible as merely inconvenient

### Satirical Targets

**What E.L. Wisty exposes:**
- Self-important people who talk endlessly
- Those who mistake verbosity for wisdom
- Delusional self-assessment
- Gap between aspiration and capability
- Pretension masking mediocrity
- Boring conversationalists who think they're fascinating

## Outputs

**Monologue that:**
- Starts mundane and ordinary
- Reveals character's delusion gradually
- Builds absurdity through earnest elaboration
- Meanders with hidden satirical purpose
- Maintains complete character consistency
- Exposes pomposity through embodiment
- Concludes without resolution or self-awareness

**Format:** First-person monologue, conversational tone, 200-500 words typically

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Target is genuine expert, not pretentious | Decline. This skill satirizes pomposity, not actual expertise. |
| Can't identify delusional element | Ask user to specify character's main delusion or self-assessment gap. |
| Rambling feels aimless, not purposeful | Ensure each tangent reveals more about character's foolishness. |
| Character seems mean rather than satirical | Add more earnestness, reduce edge. E.L. Wisty is oblivious, not cruel. |
| Monologue too short to build proper ramble | Extend with additional tangents that circle back to main delusion. |

## Example: The Universe Expert

**Input:**
`target_type`: Self-proclaimed expert on grand topics
`subject_matter`: The universe
`delusional_element`: Plans to tidy up the cosmos

**E.L. Wisty Monologue Output:**

"I'm very interested in the Universe - I'm specializing in the Universe and all that surrounds it. Quite a large field, obviously, but I feel I'm making progress.

I'm thinking of trying to get the whole thing tidied up a bit, you know, straightened out. It's all rather a mess at the moment, if you look at it objectively. Stars all over the place, galaxies just scattered about with no particular system. Very untidy.

I thought I'd start with the solar system, get that cleaned up properly, then move on to the local galaxy cluster. Of course, you need planning permission for that sort of thing. I've been to the council three times now. They keep saying they don't handle cosmic reorganization, but I think they're just being difficult.

The problem is the paperwork. Tremendous amount of paperwork involved in rearranging celestial bodies. Forms in triplicate. They want to know things like 'anticipated disruption to existing orbit patterns' and 'environmental impact assessment for solar wind redistribution.' Very bureaucratic.

I could have had the whole thing done by now, but they're very strict about the regulations. Still, once I get the proper permits, I should be able to make significant improvements. Perhaps get everything running more efficiently. The Universe is really quite inefficient at the moment, when you examine it closely.

Well, I must get on. These permits won't fill themselves out, you know."
